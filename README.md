# Faculty Data Management System

The Faculty Data Management System is a web application designed to manage the profiles and details of faculty members in an educational institution. It allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on faculty data securely.

## Features

- **Faculty Profiles:** Store and manage detailed profiles of faculty members, including personal information, contact details, academic qualifications, and more.
  
- **CRUD Operations:** Administrators can create, read, update, and delete faculty profiles as needed.
  
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure login and role-based access control (admin role) to manage faculty data.
  
- **Search and Filter:** Ability to search for faculty members by name, department, or any other relevant criteria.
  
- **Audit Trail:** Track changes made to faculty profiles with timestamps and admin/user identifiers.
  
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React for a modern and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Deployment:** Deployed on AWS EC2 (or any other cloud platform) with Docker for containerization.
